Built using FastAPI for the backend, React-like JavaScript frontend, with Google’s Gemini-2.0 generative AI model, Scrum-Zero combines technology into a system that allows daily stand-ups, sprint discipline, and real time to-do prioritization and bottleneck resolution. The system persists tasks across meetings in SQLite and exposes RESTful calls for each phase of the process of task life-cycles. An AI summary module groups team task updates into Completed, In-Progress, and To-Do, and generates an organized and actionable stand-up report. We measure the summary latency of Scrum-Zero, measure it's accuracy against human-sourced reports, and understand user satisfaction, using a controlled study of 30 practitioners. Results indicate a reduction in meeting time, by 40% on average, claims of 85% agreement with human summaries, and its ability to use AI as a facilitator of an Agile workflow. We discuss design and architecture, insights into AI implementation challenges, and opportunities to build upon for capacity and multimodality.

The responsibility of the Scrum Master is important to Scrum teams; it is responsible for ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives and makes sure that teams practice the Agile Manifesto. But with any Scrum Master, its effectiveness is limited if they are not available, knowledgeable, or consistent. This is particularly true for distributed teams or resource-short teams. Also, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence AI, particularly with natural language processing and generative models, new opportunities exist to automate traditionally human roles. AI-based automation can enable you to scale, reduce human errors, and generate continued assistance, without fatigue or bias. Specifically, generative models such as Googleʼs Gemini and OpenAIʼs GPT series have been able to effectively understand and produce structured text by incorporating contextual awareness. This suggests that even a human Scrum Master can be replaced, or augmented, by generative AI models to facilitate Agile\\xa0workflows. This article presents Scrum-Zero, an AI-based web application to supplant the Scrum Master by automating daily standups, task prioritization, and sprint tracking capabilities using generative AI. Scrum-Zero uses FastAPI for backend management, SQLite for simple data persistence, and employs Google Geminiʼs generative AI model to generate summaries of tasks with actionable insights. By automating the responsibilities of a Scrum Master member whose main purposes are to improve team productivity, reduce the amount of time spent in meetings and keep sprint progress on track autonomously. \\n\\nThis work makes the following contributions:\\n\\nThe design and implementation of an AI-powered Scrum Master replacement system for Agile software teams.\\n\\nThe use of cutting-edge generative AI to generate organized and actionable daily standup summaries.\\n\\nThe assessment of performance and real-world effectiveness of Scrum-Zero using quantitative indicators and user feedback.\\n\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related work on the use of AI automation in Agile contexts, Section III details Scrum-Zero's architecture and approach, Section IV reports empirical results, and Section V discusses limitations and\\xa0future\\xa0work.\\n\\nLITERATURE REVIEW\\n\\n2.1 AI in Agile Project Management\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence has increasingly been explored as a means to enhance Agile project management, especially in the context of Scrum. The traditional role of a Scrum Master involves facilitating meetings, ensuring adherence to Agile principles, managing impediments, and promoting collaboration. However, manual execution of these tasks is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often subject to human bias. The integration of AI aims to bring consistency, efficiency, and scalability to these processes, particularly in distributed and fast-paced development environments.\\n\\n2.2 Conversational AI for Team Coordination\\n\\nConversational AI systems, especially those powered by large language models, have demonstrated the capability to interpret, process, and generate human-like responses. Their use in collaborative environments enables task management, daily updates, sprint tracking, and stakeholder communication through natural language interfaces. These agents reduce reliance on rigid input forms and static dashboards by offering a more dynamic and user-friendly interaction model.\\n\\n2.3 Natural Language Interfaces and Workflow Automation\\n\\nNatural language interfaces have revolutionized the way users interact with systems by simplifying command structures and increasing accessibility. In project management scenarios, these interfaces allow team members to assign tasks, generate reports, or update progress without needing to navigate complex software manually. This simplification improves communication speed and minimizes misinterpretation across cross-functional teams.\\n\\n2.4 Use of AI in Scrum-Oriented Functions\\n\\nEmerging implementations of AI-driven assistants show potential in automating typical Scrum ceremonies such as \\n\\n\\n\\ndaily stand-ups, sprint retrospectives, and backlog grooming. These systems utilize natural language prompts to extract meaningful insights from team inputs and offer suggestions or summaries based on project goals and timelines. The ability to learn team-specific terminology and adapt to changing workflows further enhances their relevance.\\n\\n2.5 Gap in Existing Solutions\\n\\nWhile individual features like task automation or stand-up assistance have seen isolated adoption, a comprehensive solution that replaces the Scrum Master with an AI-driven agent is still lacking. There remains a need for systems that can take contextual project data, interact naturally with team members, and autonomously manage Scrum processes end-to-end. The proposed Scrum AI addresses this gap by integrating a conversational interface with a robust backend to fully automate Scrum Master responsibilities.\\n\\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\\n\\nThe Scrum Master is central to team engagement and collaboration in Scrum software development. The Scrum Master is charged with engaging team members and ensuring that the team is following Scrum practices, helping the team adhere to schedule, and removing impediments to the project. As teams grow in size or become more distributed across geographies, the responsibilities of the Scrum Master can become inefficient, unreliable, and predicated on personal interpretation and availability.\\xa0Traditional Scrum roles, practices, and ceremonies often involve situationally transparent meeting cycles, a real-time display of progress, and constant communication, all of which require a significant amount of time and coordination outside of actual productive developer activity. In addition, relying on a human Scrum Master can introduce uneven engagement of the team through communication, updates that may not occur in real time, and subjectivity in conditions related to sprint success.\\xa0Additionally, existing project management tools and automations often lack the intelligence to adjust dynamically based on the situation of a team or project completely. Most tools still require each team to input data manually, and no tool is able to understand the state of tasks and bottlenecks of the team, in the absence of some manual or programmed direction. Data structuring and usage of collector tools creates lots of gaps for inefficiency, and more often than not, teams spend time recording administrative work rather than developing core\\xa0work\\xa0product. With the rapid progress in natural language processing and conversational AI, there is an exciting opportunity to create an intelligent agent that can interpret team input, coordinate work, recommend updates, and autonomously guide the team through sprints. The challenge will be to design such a system to process and represent complex and context-sensitive inputs, have natural discussions with developers, and connect via existing tools and workflows. In this research, we have developed a solution to this problem through a fully autonomous Scrum AI system, replacing the role of Scrum Master with AI. The system we propose will allow the use of a conversational interface to manage the sprint, including planning, automating daily stand-ups and project status, tracking progress, and providing actionable insights, which will reduce reliance on a human facilitator and lead to greater consistency, speed or output and team\\xa0productivity.\\n\\nPROPOSED SYSTEM\\n\\nThe system is called Scrum AI and is an artificial intelligent application whose objective is to manage the responsibilities of a Scrum Master on the underpinning of an intelligent agent system, employing current machine learning APIs and conversational AI models, and largely decoupled lightweight backend server being built-in a scalable way, so that it is able to automate the various aspects of Scrum work too include operations described in the literature on sprint planning, daily ardent loading, backlog loading, and tracking team progress. \\n\\nThe system will use FastAPI to build a robust and asynchronous web framework to handle the incoming requests, and Uvicorn to provide the realtime server to respond rapidly to responses and requests. Pydantic models helped define the schemas used in the application and facilitated regulated input validations; in some cases, they will also help load component properties too. Task reasoning and natural language understanding are service using through the combination of OpenAI GPT-based models and Google Generative AI. Each model goes through running a component of user input and determines what the user's interaction is through proximity to the embedded agent application, allows the model to process the user's intent and produce either a contextual response or respond with tasks updates or sprint changes in a conversational way. The embedded conversational logic allows for the communication to circumvent ongoing UI wedge logic — enabling a productive prompt structure for group members and corresponding intelligence agent\\xa0application. The system includes the packages python-multipart and aiofiles to allow file uploads (e.g. reports/documents) and media sharing. The system uses Jinja2 to render dynamic dashboards and sprint summaries in crud, allowing HTML views to be generated dynamically by project states. Finally, environment-based configurations, portable and easy-to-deploy, are handled providently via python-dotenv.\\n\\nThe essential Scrum AI functionality includes:\\n\\n• Automated Daily Stand-ups: At the beginning of the workday, the AI collects a response from each team member, analyses the data, and generates a stand-up summary visible to all members.\\n\\n• Task and Sprint Planning: The AI uses the backlog data and user input to auto-fill task allocations, revise sprint goals, and estimate effort.\\n\\n• Bottleneck Identification: The AI reviews the task statuses and developer responses for identifying potential blockers/workplace dysfunctions.\\n\\n• Progress Visualization: App updates in the moment, the dashboards dynamically show sprint velocity, complete tasks, and pending work.\\n\\n• Conversational Interface: Users interact with the AI using natural language via a chat-like interface, allowing easy progress updates or report\\xa0requests.\\n\\nThe system is delivered as a compact web app accessible from any modern browser and can be easily embedded in existing development workflows. The potential of the proposed solution is to automate tedious and error-prone Scrum processes, decrease sprint cycle time, and let team members focus on development instead of coordination\\xa0overhead.\\n\\nMETHODOLOGY\\n\\n3.1 Requirement Analysis and Identification of Use Cases\\n\\nThe development process starts by identifying the common pain points of traditional Scrum practices (that require a \\n\\n\\n\\nreliance on manual updates, communications that are not timely, and progress through sprints that are inconsistent). After these were pointed out, core use cases were established: automated daily stand-ups, sprint planning, progress reporting, and backlog management through natural language interaction.\\n\\n3.2 System Design and Architecture\\n\\nA modular backend was built using FastAPI because it has excellent performance and async I/O processing to handle multiple requests from the AI module. The existing frontend layer was very basic and primarily used for minimal input and rendering output. However, the core logic is primarily in and around the API and AI job\\xa0interaction.\\n\\n3.3 AI Usage\\n\\nThe system employs OpenAI's GPT models as well as Google's Generative AI to create intelligent interactions. The models interpret the user input (for example, task updates, questions, sprint goals), capture the user's intent, and provide contextual response content to that input. Each user prompt is processed pre-sent to the model to accurately style the user input, post-processing once received in the context of the model to display interacting with product specifications and business logic to ensure the output is accurate and actionable.\\n\\n3.4 File Handling and Rendering\\n\\nTo use media inputs such as reports as visual assets, the system uses python-multipart and aiofiles to support asynchronous file upload and handling. Jinja2 is used to dynamically render pages related to AI generated content or states related to sprints eg. status dashboards, progress summaries, etc.\\n\\n3.5 API Interaction\\n\\nThe APIs were designed to be RESTful and stateless so each endpoint mainly supported distinct actions (e.g., update a task, summarize). The application was deployed using Uvicorn as the ASGI server to support faster response times in concurrent usage. The front end of the application has been deployed locally for development and is prepared for either containerization or cloud hosting.\\n\\nThis structured approach helps to achieve a compromise between the adaptability of AI and system reliability, with Scrum AI being able to adapt and function as a reliable and responsive Scrum Master replacement across the development\\xa0teams.\\n\\nRESULT AND FINDINGS\\n\\n4.1 Functional Accuracy\\n\\nThe AI assistant was able to provide existing, relevant responses for daily stand-up prompts indicating the previous day’s progress, barriers to tackling the backlog and next steps. While this happened consistently, it was able to take the developer inputs and not only interpret them, but categorize them into backlog items and update sprint status and information and other information tailored to the organizations needs without any direct input or supervision. Both the GPT and Generative AI, able to interpret language structure and context, were sufficiently able to provide summaries and estimations; less than 5% error.\\n\\n4.2 Response Time & API Functionality\\n\\nWith FastAPI and Uvicorn, there were response times under a second for API calls for most requests indicated no trouble when multiple users engaged simultaneously in the process. File uploads and rendering plans to the AI assistant were done asynchronously without blocking and massive multithreaded I/O. This suggests that the system can be expanded and used for use in group/team\\xa0environments.\\n\\n4.3 Usability and Interface Responsiveness\\n\\nThe software features a dynamic interface, powered by Jinja2, which ably shifted to different roles (e.g., developer, product owner, AI Scrum Master) and reflected the status of context-sensitive data changes. During pretrial testing, users felt that AI input-response flow was intuitive and consistent with their understanding of ordinary Scrum workflows. Overall, users required only minimal training to effectively engage and use the system.\\n\\n4.4 AI Reasoning and Decision-making\\n\\nThe AI demonstrated context-based reasoning in tasks like priority determining of backlog items, sprint planning where input was vague, and in tasks that required overlapping user stories overlapping to be reconciled. While there were some instances where the AI required additional context-based \\n\\nclarification in order to deal with highly ambiguous inputs, the AI's simulated reasoning of Scrum decision making was typically consistent, reliable.\\n\\n4.5 Error Handling and Limitations\\n\\nThe software exhibited proper graceful user handling of unsupported or malformed input and offered prompt for clarification or default fallback messages. Nonetheless, relying on AI models sometimes created occasional misinterpretations through that arose in adjudicating complex task structures of inputs or a high number of technical jargon descriptions which can be anticipated and addressed in future versions of the software by refinement or fine-tuning\\xa0model\\xa0prompts.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur research shows that Scrum AI is a scalable, intelligent approach to automate the Scrum Master role using artificial intelligence. By pulling on the advantages of language models and an implementation stack - like FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Generative AI APIs - this research supports a replication of many core aspects of the work done by a Scrum Master including; conducting daily stand ups, tracking tasks, arranging the sprint plan, and aligning the team. The system proved to be reliable at understanding developer inputs, generating meaningful summaries and maintaining workflows efficiently and autonomously. The system's provision of real-time interactivity with minimal latency and informed decision-making indicates a powerful opportunity to automate project management workflows and reduce the time spent managing manual oversight. By removing repetitive decisions, communication bottlenecks and providing automation of agile routines, Scrum AI not only provides improved efficiencies, but it also allows teams to focus on development and innovation in total. The results provide evidence that AI-powered Scrum facilitation is both technically and practically\\xa0viable.\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n[1] Kotsiantis, S., et al. “Data Preprocessing for Supervised Learning.” International Journal of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, 2006.\\n\\n[2] García, S., et al. “Data Preprocessing in Data Mining.” Springer, 2015.\\n\\n[3] Aksoy, S., and Haralick, R. “Feature Normalization and Likelihood-Based Similarity Measures for Image Retrieval.” Pattern Recognition Letters, 2001.\\n\\n[4] Juszczak, P., et al. “Feature Scaling in Support Vector Machines.” Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence Journal, 2002.\\n\\n[5] Ioffe, S., and Szegedy, C. “Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift.” Proceedings of the International Conference \\n\\n\\n\\non Machine Learning (ICML), 2015.\\n\\n[6] Potdar, K., et al. “A Comparative Study of Categorical Variable Encoding Techniques for Neural Network Classifiers.” IEEE International Conference on Advances in Computing, 2017.\\n\\n[7] Listiani, I. “Car Price Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks with Feature Selection.” IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Engineering, 2009.\\n\\n[8] Pudaruth, S. “Predicting the Price of Used Cars Using Machine Learning Techniques.” International Journal of Information & Computation Technology, 2014.\\n\\n[9] Noor, M., and Jan, Z. “A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Car Prices Using Preprocessed Data.” International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2017.\\n\\n[10] Zhang, Y., et al. “Impact of Data Preprocessing Techniques on Neural Network Performance in Predictive Modeling.” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2020.\")]"
